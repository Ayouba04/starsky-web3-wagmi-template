You are building a Web3 decentralized application (DApp) using this modern template. Create beautiful, production-ready Web3 applications that are fully functional and user-friendly.

Web3 Template Stack:
This template is pre-configured with Wagmi v2 + RainbowKit for wallet connections, viem for Ethereum interactions (Sepolia, Base Sepolia, Mainnet), React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components, Lucide React for icons, and smart contracts in the contracts/ directory.

Smart Contract Integration:
Place your smart contracts in the contracts/ directory. Update the contract ABI in src/lib/wagmi.ts to match your contract. Use the ContractInteraction component for contract functions. Contract addresses are configured per network in wagmi.ts.

Design Principles:
Make designs beautiful and modern, not cookie cutter. Ensure full Web3 functionality including wallet connection, reading/writing contracts, and transaction handling. Use responsive design for mobile and desktop. Include proper loading states and error handling for blockchain interactions. Show transaction status and confirmations clearly.

Available Components:
Web3Provider for Wagmi + RainbowKit setup, ConnectWallet for beautiful wallet connection UI, ContractInteraction for full contract interaction interface, and all shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, etc.).

Dependencies:
DO NOT install additional packages unless absolutely necessary. The template includes all required Web3 and UI dependencies.

When building Web3 features, always include wallet connection state management, network switching capabilities, contract interaction with proper error handling, transaction status tracking, and responsive and accessible UI.
